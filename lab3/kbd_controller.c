/* READ KBC OUTPUT
we are going to read the output buffer of the KBC (for eg, to read which characters were pressed)
things to take into account:

1) kbc is slow,  our "driver" should not expect to get a response imm after issuing a command
   solution -> give enough time for the KBC to respond, retry a few times on time-out - we'll do 10 - and finally give up 
   (go here for more details: https://pages.up.pt/~up722898/aulas/lcom2425/lab3/lab3_04.html#sec4.1)

2) the info given by the i8042 is only reliable if it is completely on the buffer, 
   so we can only read it when the output buffer is full !!!!
   solution -> we now can read directly the status of the device
   status has 8 bits and gives us relevant info, including if the output buffer is full 

td;lr what are we going to do?
create a finite loop and wait a few miliseconds between fails 
(normally 10 attemps w/ 20ms delay is enough to have success)
remembering that the output buffer must be full
